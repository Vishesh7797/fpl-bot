# fpl-bot

A very simple Fantasy Premier League bot that can post:
* Live scoring (currently goals and assists)
* Price change warnings
* Price changes

It can post to Discord.

Live scoring and price changes are fetched from the API at fantasy.premierleague.com

Price change warnings are fetched from the API at fplstatistics.co.uk

## How to add it to your Discord server:

Go here: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=527633925909250051&permissions=2048&scope=bot

## Technical description

The bot is written in Java 8 using Spring Boot 2.1.0 and Maven.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

Before the bot can run you need to update the configuration to your liking, especially the Discord token.

## How to run

`mvn clean package && java -jar target/fpl-bot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Currently running

The bot is currently posting messages to:
* **Discord - r/FantasyPL** - [Click here to join](https://discordapp.com/invite/GgcY5gK)

## Icons

When the bot posts goals it will expect team icons to be avaliable in Slack using :team_name: format. I can't add the images here since they are copyrighted but i can tell you how to get them.

### OSX
1. Download this pack or any other suitable ICO pack: http://www.iconarchive.com/show/english-football-club-icons-by-giannis-zographos.html
2. Install ImageMagick
3. Clean all the ICO file names with this bash command (ImageMagick cant handle spaces): `for f in *\ *; do mv "$f" "${f// /_}"; done`
4. Convert them from ICO to PNG: `for file in *.ico; do convert $file 128x128 new-$file.png; done`
5. Rename the outputted icon names to match what the bot expects: [See here](src/main/java/fpl/bot/live/score/FplOfficialLiveScoreFetcher.java#L114-L135)
6. Upload the icons to your Slack or Discord server

### UNIX
If you are running UNIX i think you can manage yourself, it will propably be similar to the OSX way

### Windows
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Roadmap
Here is a brief list of TODO's.

* Automatically adjust what the current gameweek is
* Only poll the live score API when actual matches are ongoing
* Listen for configuration changes on the fly
* Post a message when a game is about to start?
* Post final scores of matches?
* Post BPS and BP at end of a match?
